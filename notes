1) sp identification -> manually using experience
    Assuming the app is a big loop and that there are no global variables. 
2) update type: instantaneous, which requires blocking ...  
3) state transformation functions behavior fixed a priori, defined by the user (safety responsibility on the user!)

?) global structure with pointers to routines which can be updated -> how can dynamic change be implemented? 
?) statically linked program -> like they say in DSU
